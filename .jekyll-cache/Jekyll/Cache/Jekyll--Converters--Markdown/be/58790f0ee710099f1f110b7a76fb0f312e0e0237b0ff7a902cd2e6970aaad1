I"™<p>I think I first came across the concept of a trie (pronouced <em>try</em>) when I was reading the book <em>Cracking the Coding Interiew</em>. But I never really gave it much thought. Plus, I never came across a problem on <a href="https://www.leetcode.com">Leet Code</a> where I had to use one. But I recently came across a problem where using a trie was the only way to efficiently solve the problem.</p>
