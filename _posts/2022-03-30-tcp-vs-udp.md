### TCP vs UDP
Both TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) vs. UDP (User/Universal Datagram Protocol) are transport layer protocols of the TCP/IP protocol stack. Both of them use the IP protocol.

### TCP 
* Connection orientated protocol
* Typically used when requires guaranteed message delivery (high reliability)
* Has built it error recovery and retransmission
* Sets up connection using a 3-way handshake 
    1. Send SYN (synchronize sequence number), informs the server that it wants to establish a connection
    2. The server responds to the client by sending SYN-ACK (acknowledgment) 
    3. The client responds to the server with ACK. Once a reliable connection is established, a two-way data transfer is possible

### UDP
* Connectionless protocol (no handshake mechanism)
* Data can be sent but cannot know whether it was successfully delivered on not (typically for apps that require fast data transfers)
* Error handling must be done on the receiving side
* Faster than TCP because there is no connection setup (less network traffic) and does not consume resources on receiving side (does not keep the connection open)
