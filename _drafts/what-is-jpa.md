### What is Java Persistence API (JPA)?


### Why use JPA?
* reduce repetitive code
* speed up development
* focus of OOP style programming without worrying about how to map each to the DB
* less chances of error by not handling raw queries

### Spring Data JPA
* wrapper class to facilitate use of JPA
* recommended over using hibernate or jpa
* easily switch between databases without modifying entire code base (due to the use of same CRUD operations in the interfaces)
