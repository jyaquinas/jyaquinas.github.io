    * jpa doesnt work in webmvctest? only inits controller and controller advice
    * HttpEntity
    * ResponseEntity

* Spring/JPA Annotations

    * automatically checks if objects have been modified and will update regularly (when session flushed or transaction is commited)

## Misc Subjects
* What is java bean?
    * objects that are managed by spring IoC container
* Linux wildcards -> file searching
    * `*` match one or more occurrences of characters, including none
    * `?` match single occurrence of character
    * `[]` match any occurrence of characters in the enclosed bracket
    * ./tmp/* matches files and folders in ./tmp
    * ./tmp/** matches files, folders, and subfolders in ./tmp
    * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3529997/unix-wildcard-selectors-asterisks
    
### Application Layers?
* it is not recommended to use the entity class as the request/response class
    * DB table is based on this entity class, and making many changes to the entity class can be costly
    * recommended to separate the view and DB layer
    * use a Dto class, and generate the entity class through it - `toEntity()`


### Data Access Object (DAO) vs Data Transfer Object (DTO)
* DAO -> class that has CRUD operations
* DTO -> object that holds data
* POJO (plain old java object) -> java object that defines an entity

### Running Tests With Spring
```java
@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest // initializes the H2database for test
public class PostsRepositoryTest {

    @Autowired
    PostsRepository postsRepository;

    @After  // function executed after test
    public void cleanup(){
        postsRepository.deleteAll();
    }

    @Test
    public void saveAndGetPosts(){
        String title = "Test Post";
        String content = "Test content";

        // Create posts instance through builder pattern (lombok @Builder)
        // save() -> inserts/updates to table
        postsRepository.save(Posts.builder()
                .title(title)
                .content(content)
                .author("author@email.com")
                .build());

        // returns all rows of table (or instances of type)
        List<Posts> postList = postsRepository.findAll();

        Posts posts = postList.get(0);
        assertThat(posts.getTitle()).isEqualTo(title);
        assertThat(posts.getContent()).isEqualTo(content);

    }
}
```

#### Checking Executed Queries
If you'd like to check the actual queries that were executed during the tests, create a file named 'application.properties' under src/main/resources.
Add the following line:
`spring.jpa.show_sql=true`
`spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect`

Then you'll be able to see the queries in the test results.
```shell
Hibernate: drop table if exists posts CASCADE 
Hibernate: create table posts (id bigint generated by default as identity, author varchar(255), content TEXT not null, title varchar(500) not null, primary key (id))
...
```
